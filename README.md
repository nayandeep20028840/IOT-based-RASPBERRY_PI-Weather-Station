# IOT based RASPBERRY_PI Weather Station
• The project has two different sensors (DHT11 and BMP180) that gather the values of temperature, humidity and pressure  from the atmosphere.<br/>
• These sensor values are continuously fed to a digital controller.<br/>
• A Raspberry Pi single-board computer with built-in Wi-Fi is used as a digital controller in our project.<br/>
• The Raspberry Pi controller stores and processes the sensor data and sends it to a remote web server by means of IOT communication protocols.<br/>
• On the webserver side, a graphical user interface can be developed to properly visualize the weather data in tabular or graph format.<br/>

# Working
• Run Python Program in Terminal to Initialize Raspberry Pi.<br/>
• Data Collected from DHT11 and BMP 180 Sensors.<br/>
• Raspberry Pi send collected data to remote web server.<br/>
• Data Visualization using Thingspeak.<br/>
• Real time data analysis on Raspcontroller App.<br/>
