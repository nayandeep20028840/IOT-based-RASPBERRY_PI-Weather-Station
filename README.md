# IOT based RASPBERRY_PI Weather Station
• The project has two different sensors (DHT11 and BMP180) that gather the values of temperature, humidity and pressure  from the atmosphere.<br/>
• These sensor values are continuously fed to a digital controller.<br/>
• A Raspberry Pi single-board computer with built-in Wi-Fi is used as a digital controller in our project.<br/>
• The Raspberry Pi controller stores and processes the sensor data and sends it to a remote web server by means of IOT communication protocols.<br/>
• On the webserver side, a graphical user interface can be developed to properly visualize the weather data in tabular or graph format.<br/>

# Working
• Run Python Program in Terminal to Initialize Raspberry Pi.<br/>
• Data Collected from DHT11 and BMP 180 Sensors.<br/>
• Raspberry Pi send collected data to remote web server.<br/>
• Data Visualization using Thingspeak.<br/>
• Real time data analysis on Raspcontroller App.<br/>

## Application Development

• The RaspController application allows you to easily manage your Raspberry Pi remotely. Now it is possible for files, to control the GPIO ports, send commands directly through the terminal, view images from a connected camera and obtain data from different sensors. Finally, wiring diagrams, pins and various information are available for the correct use of the Raspberry Pi.

# Features of the app:

• GPIO Management.<br/>
• CPU, Ram, Storage, Network monitoring.<br/>
• Support for DHT11/22 sensors (Humidity and temperature).<br/>
• Support for DS18B20 sensors (Temperature).<br/>
• Support for BMP sensors (Pressure, temperature, altitude).<br/>

## ThingSpeak

• ThingSpeak is an IoT analytics platform service that allows you to aggregate , visualize and analyze live data streams in the cloud. You can send data to ThingSpeak from your devices , create instant visualization of live data , and send alerts. ThingSpeak enables engineers and scientists to prototype and build IoT systems without setting up servers or developing web software . It is an open data platform for the internet of things . Your device or application can communicate with ThingSpeak using a RESTful API , and you can either keep your data private or make it public.<br/>
