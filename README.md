# IOT based RASPBERRY_PI Weather Station
 The project has two different sensors (DHT11 and BMP180) that gather the values of temperature, humidity and pressure  from the atmosphere.  These sensor values are continuously fed to a digital controller.  A Raspberry Pi single-board computer with built-in Wi-Fi is used as a digital controller in our project.  The Raspberry Pi controller stores and processes the sensor data and sends it to a remote web server by means of IOT communication protocols.  On the webserver side, a graphical user interface can be developed to properly visualize the weather data in tabular or graph format
