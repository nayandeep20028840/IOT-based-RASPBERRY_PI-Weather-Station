# IOT based RASPBERRY_PI Weather Station

• The project introduces an IoT-based Weather Monitoring System using Raspberry Pi, which provides real-time weather data.<br/>
• The primary objective is to address the need for up-to-date weather information to facilitate preparation and decision-making based on current weather conditions.<br/>
• The system incorporates DHT11 and BMP180 sensors to measure temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure, which are crucial environmental parameters for weather assessment.<br/>
• The project utilizes ThingSpeak, an IoT platform, to collect, analyze, and visualize weather data, making it accessible over the internet.<br/>
• A user-friendly RaspController app is employed for remote management and monitoring of the Raspberry Pi.<br/>
• Applications of the system include digital temperature monitoring in laboratories, greenhouse temperature control, and environment monitoring in warehouses and factories.<br/>

# Working

• Run Python Program in Terminal to Initialize Raspberry Pi.<br/>
• Data Collected from DHT11 and BMP 180 Sensors.<br/>
• Raspberry Pi send collected data to remote web server.<br/>
• Data Visualization using Thingspeak.<br/>
• Real time data analysis on Raspcontroller App.<br/>

# Application Development

• The RaspController application allows you to easily manage your Raspberry Pi remotely. Now it is possible for files, to control the GPIO ports, send commands directly through the terminal, view images from a connected camera and obtain data from different sensors. Finally, wiring diagrams, pins and various information are available for the correct use of the Raspberry Pi.

# ThingSpeak

• ThingSpeak is an IoT analytics platform service that allows you to aggregate , visualize and analyze live data streams in the cloud. You can send data to ThingSpeak from your devices , create instant visualization of live data , and send alerts. ThingSpeak enables engineers and scientists to prototype and build IoT systems without setting up servers or developing web software . It is an open data platform for the internet of things . Your device or application can communicate with ThingSpeak using a RESTful API , and you can either keep your data private or make it public.<br/>

## Strenghts

• Data from the sensors can be sent to the web page or app which can be accessed from anywhere in the world.<br/>
• The system is cost-effective and affordable. So that everyone can use it freely.<br/>
• High accuracy, Easy to use.<br/>

## Applications

• Digital temperature monitoring in laboratories.<br/>
• Temperature monitoring in greenhouses.<br/>
• Environment monitoring of warehouses for food safety.<br/>
• Equipment monitoring in factories.<br/>

## Future scope of our Project

• The IOT Based weather Informative System is proposed to Real time Applications. It doesn’t need of any data centers physically because of we are creating a data Server in Cloud so that it doesn’t require any datacenter further. So It Reduces the Cost of Equipment. Many of the Innovative Researchers are interested towards The IOT based Real time Applications. So this System will helps to the Researcher for their further investigation of weather details.<br/>
• The IOT Based Weather Informative System not only displays the weather parameters like Temperature, Altitude, Humidity and Pressure etc., but it also displays the weather location, Industry, Time and other weather information from this we can forecasts the weather details.<br/>
